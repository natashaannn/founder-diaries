# Proto-Persona: The Distracted Crammer

## Demographics
- **Age:** Mid-20s  
- **Role:** Backend Software Engineer (converted from internship)  
- **Location:** Singapore  
- **Career Stage:** Early career, ~1 year into first full-time role  
- **Education:** Recent graduate (Computer Science background with some AI coursework)  

---

## Background
- Converted internship into full-time role; limited formal interview experience after that.  
- Last external interview was ~7 months ago at a subsidiary of A Star.  
- Backend-focused but aspires to move into full stack.  
- Likes to talk about past projects and systems built; finds informal interviews easier than technical ones.  
- Reads novels obsessively and can binge on them for hours, unlike coding practice.  

---

## Goals & Motivations
- **Career Growth:** Wants to expand beyond backend into full stack roles.  
- **Learning:** Prefers gamified, bite-sized, mobile-friendly learning experiences (e.g., React app with progress tracking and rewards).  
- **Interview Success:** Wants to feel confident in both informal and technical interviews.  
- **Personal Discipline:** Struggles to build consistent study/practice habits.

## Behaviors
- **Interview Prep:**  
  - Cramming style → practices LeetCode non-stop for a few days before interviews.  
  - Gives 15–20 minutes on a problem before checking solutions.  
  - Compares answers with community solutions, sometimes writes step-by-step explanations to understand better.  
- **AI Use:**  
  - Uses Perplexity to brainstorm ideas and structure system design thinking.  
  - Dislikes relying on AI for coding; feels it reduces learning.  
  - Has GitHub Copilot but disables it during interviews.  
- **Learning Habits:**  
  - Highly consistent with entertainment content (novels, shows, stories).  
  - Struggles with coding practice because it requires “setup” and feels less accessible than reading.  
  - Motivated by gamified formats and progress tracking.  
- **Work Style:**  
  - Comfortable explaining backend systems and decisions.  
  - Prefers informal, conversational interviews over strict technical grilling.

## Pain Points
- Out of practice with technical interviews.  
- Finds LeetCode and coding prep mentally draining compared to reading stories.  
- Easily distracted by hobbies; lacks discipline to build daily practice routine.  
- Last-minute cramming leads to stress and uneven prep.  
- Formal learning platforms (Coursera, etc.) feel too heavy and demotivating.  
- Concerned about consistency — knows she *should* practice daily but doesn’t.  

---

## Needs
- Structured, guided prep plans that reduce decision fatigue.  
- Progress tracking and gamified elements to encourage consistency.  
- Low-barrier practice tools that feel as easy to start as opening a novel.  
- Feedback not just on correctness, but also on communication and interview behavior (e.g., filler words, eye contact).  
- Motivation nudges that help replace cramming with consistent, bite-sized practice.

## Quotes
- *“I feel okay in informal interviews, but I’m out of practice with technical ones.”*  
- *“I can binge on novels for hours, but with coding practice, I just can’t start — it takes too much setup.”*  
- *“I usually cram three or four days before interviews, doing LeetCode nonstop.”*  
- *“I like Perplexity for brainstorming system design, but I don’t want AI to just write code for me — I learn less that way.”*
