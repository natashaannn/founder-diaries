## Cleaned Transcript

Q: You mentioned interviews — tell me about how you feel about them.
- A: Oh, I want to be something, yeah. I, for right now, unprepared — you are preparing, you want to be... I want to be in a more— the bad thing I would say, like, I in general feel like, I was, general feel okay just going to like a van interview and like, as long as it's like one of the more informal kind of interviews, like more of the more like less formal companies that like just, I feel like I'm confident enough to go there and talk about my work, talk about my, like, where I do, like that kind of — you actually feel like I'm more or less confident about. I would say that I'm not as confident about technical interviews because I haven't really done equal in a while and, yeah, like I feel like I'm out of practice for technical tests as well.

Q: When was your last technical interview?
- A: I think it would be like… June? Like… yeah, yeah, yeah. Like seven— seven months ago. Wait, months ago? Interviewing? Oh, no, for my— so my time company is just I just converted my internship. I didn't really have to have a paper dinner for it. I went to like a subsidiary of A Star. I went for a couple for that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that was — the last time I went to — yeah.

Q: How long was that process?
- A: So, okay, I was a-awk and at that time I had already got an offer from my current company, so I kind of like led them along a bit. So my process was like not really the typical process in that company, but we had like a round with like two people with our senior people, like just talking to them — just understanding like what kind of roles they are looking for, because they were looking for multiple roles. So understanding like what kind of stuff they do, what kind of roles they are looking for, like what I have done so far and what kind of stuff I'm looking to do, basically. So it was just like a more technical-behaviour-y where I was just explaining about what I've done, where I'm good, and what I'm not good at. That's — I would say that they didn't have a system design to me per se. It was just like, because by the time I had already done my internship, like I had already created a kind of like a system for—I didn't have to. So it was more of like, "oh, what have you made? How is it working? How does this work into the best?" Like this stuff like that. Yeah.

Q: Did they talk about AI at all in that interview?
- A: Any chance in this interview, did they ask anything about AI? I would say that — I remember if it was this interview or the one after. No, in this one — in this one, they talked about what they do. And so like they were talking about, they use like a specific mix of AI and algorithms to kind of like, on one of—they use [them]. So they were talking about that and they were like kind of hitting it off each other, like kind of brain-swarming on how I would solve particular kinds of questions — like a travelling series kind of problem thing. So I wouldn't say it was very AI, but it did touch some AI maybe. It was just like it happened in conversation; it happened in normalation—also because I mentioned that I had a specialization in AI. So I think they were asking more about that as well. But I did tell them that personally I'm more of a back-end person and that I have not worked with AI much in my stuff; my knowledge is more basic.

Q: So you’re not specialized in software with AI?
- A: Oh, so your specialisation is just not in AI? Yeah, yeah, that’s what I chose. Yeah. That's the only contact that I've had with the AI, actually. So like I almost play software. It's like for this they will have multiple roles then they put calls like what roles for them to be. Because now you don't do that, they did AI for the roles — AI. So they have teams, which they were filling in. So like the person I got into the referral, like, he's very — he's like he has a master's in AI so it's like very AI. He's a researcher basically. So they have a team of researchers who are trying to find the best algorithm, the best model to do a certain kind of stuff. And then they have a team of software — looks like they have teams which consist of AI engineers and engineers. Like maybe they have big people — they have teams which are made up of different kinds of roles and they work together to solve, like, create these requirements for different kinds of [projects]. Because they are ASTA, so like they're very research-focused. So yeah, so the team works together to solve some problems basically. Yeah, so they had and like, so their work was also like very well — like maybe JetBrains-y, I would say. So it's like, oh maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah. And like it's industrial research in a way. So depending on what the clients want, maybe you are on one project which is like very — so like it's very, I would say like a moving in many ways; it would keep changing what project you're on, what role you're doing. It looks like you don't have a data scientist on your game, you might need to become some — you don't have a — yeah, maybe you need to become some because it's kind of like a little bit of everything. You know, a little bit of everything kind of. I just more interested to the team. Yeah.

Q: Do they ask whether you are AI-focused or software-focused?
- A: Yeah. They also had more research-focused people or more AI people. So they just wanted to know if I'm more AI-focused or if I'm more software-focused. I don't — you feel I expected. You can feel more about AI how. I mean, if you're in for the AI role, I think they would have asked more AI-related questions than general. But because I told them from the start that I'm more of a software person, they asked questions more about engineering. Like, for example, "if I have a real-time system, what kind of languages should I be using? Like, you know, like, don't use Python for a system where real-time communication is required—why?" I said like, "oh, can you use C++?" and I'm like, "why should you be using that? Why not? Why?" I was like, "look..." Yeah. This interview experience has been very different.

Q: How did other interviews differ?
- A: The experience I had with my current company, when I was interviewing for them, was more related to my previous internship because they had a special problem they wanted me to solve and I had done something kind of related in my previous internship. So they were like, "okay, this is the problem we have—do you think your previous experience would be useful here?" It was a completely different kind. The people who were interviewing me were not all working in the current company — they were more business people who saw this problem I have — and then there was another one who was very, very technical. They were like, "oh, so this is also for language for like LLM-like application kind of thing," but it was not LLM, it was more like… what's it called? I forgot the exact name. There’s computer vision and there's the name of it — no, it's language. I forgot. But basically there's this entire field which focuses entirely on that. I didn't complete the post on this; I forgot the name of the course. But basically it's the field which came up with analysis. Because ANNs are made from different parts, right? So there are Transformers for that, there are things that have tokenization — all of that is part of that. Yeah, so all of this becomes one specific phase whose name I can't get down. That's like a field in machine learning, yes. I’m forgetting it now.

Q: So the internship asked about embeddings and model choices?
- A: Yeah — it was very technical, like, "which kind of optimizer should we be using? Which AI or embedding should you use?" and it was a lot of focus on that because it was at that research-y place. Before that I had an interview with, I think, Otto. That was a very generic technical interview in front of a whiteboard. Before that we had more behavioural interviews where I'm like, "okay, this is what we do" and I'm like, "okay, this is what I can do." Other than that it was a very technical, textbook-style technical interview — they give you a question and you code in front of them. Those interviews were in the last year. I would say from, you know, this is almost two years [ago]. So now moving to the present — you haven't been to more (recent ones). Yes.

Q: What roles are you aiming for now?
- A: I would say that I'm still looking for post-grad kind of roles. I have been very backend-focused still now, but through this role I am planning on moving more into second-stack [full stack]. I feel like I already have some experience with infra, crowd (?) and all of that and I feel like I will be able to get some experience with front-end development for this job as well. After that I'll be looking for more full-stack kinds. But I think as a base, I enjoy backend.

Q: How are you currently preparing?
- A: I'm not [preparing actively]. But I would assume that my plan so far is just to keep doing what I'm doing right now: keep learning, keep working so I won't get out of touch. I feel like I really used to start coding a lot more. One thing is, I want to write proper notes for the modules — like as a refresher of what I learned in school. Like the basic topics, especially networking, security, even AI models — just refresh my memory and structure what I've learned into something more cohesive. Like link everything together. So yeah, that's something I plan on doing and I haven't started doing it.

Q: How do you feel interviews for grads vs experienced hires differ?
- A: Interview styles change. From what I've heard (just hearsay) what people expect from a graduate isn't what they expect from someone with one year of experience. I think you will be expected to know more of why things are a certain way — like know the theory behind some stuff. But a lot of the code interview is still about how you think; I feel that is still adopted by many companies.

Q: Do you use AI tools in your workflow?
- A: Apparently, you are single-infection in that. Oh, yeah. I use them a lot. It's a lifesaver. I'm using like a super-label or something, but I feel like it doesn't really matter which one we use, because I don't really like the session where you ask the AI to quote things out for you — because I feel like I'm learning less and I have less joy over what it's doing. So I don't use that one at all. I don't use solutions that just spit code out. But I do go to places like Perplexity — I often go to them when I want to iron out my thoughts, because I like to take architectural brainstorming notes. I open Perplexity and do mind-storming on how I want certain things to live. I like to type it out because it helps. So I go like, "okay this is what I'm trying to do, this is what I'm thinking—what do you think? Any suggestions? Best way to implement something like that?" Something like that. I use Perplexity a lot to bring parts of my thinking together.

Q: Did you ever use Copilot during interviews?
- A: I actually used it once in my AutoDesk interview — I had Copilot enabled. I was working on VS [Visual Studio/VS Code] right during then and I had to go and disable it, and they mentioned, "oh, at least we know you are able to incorporate AI within your workflow." We didn't really discuss more of how I used it, but it was a passing comment. Oh, interesting. Yeah — during the interview, I had to disable it. I had not done it before — I just did it in front of them. So they explicitly [noticed]. I mean, I was stressing when I realized it was still on because I'd already started. I was like, "oh no — I forgot to turn it off" and I had to tell them. Yeah. That was it.

Q: Do you feel you need to mention AI usage proactively?
- A: I think I wouldn't volunteer information unless someone specifically asked. I feel usually in interviews there’s a certain wave — like screening interviews that lead to the main interviews. I usually don't talk about things that have not been used unless it's relevant.

Q: Are you embarrassed about using AI?
- A: Not really. I feel like it's a tool, same as using VS instead of something else. I mean, at this point if you're not using the tool that's — you're missing out, right? And it's fine for interviews.

Q: What stresses you in interviews apart from technical content?
- A: There were parts that stressed me: the automated portions, for example. Do you think you would use a tool to help guide you to use questions? I feel like I like using tools. You know that one place which is like, something 25 or something 75, 975 or something — that's a challenge. I think there's like a specific thing. There's this one website that gives a list of questions you should practice when preparing for interviews. You tell it how many weeks left before your interview and it gives you a plan of how many questions and what kinds. So I feel like that's useful — because I'm like, "okay, I just need to do these and I'm done."

Q: Do you time your practice sessions?
- A: I haven't used anything to time how much time I spend. But I think that site and similar ones give you random questions. I haven't used anything except that "Line 75 kind of thing" — it's also like Z-something. It gives random red code questions.

Q: When you were studying, what prep tools were recommended?
- A: When I was preparing there were recommended tools. One was like an interview platform, like "B interview" kind of thing. There was also one where you answer and it writes how much you started, how much you maintained, and it churns down a score and stuff. Oh — really? She’s London? That’s films. It just asks you to reply back and then will say, "Oh, yes — now." I think that was the name of the platform I used. We had one platform that was like a JioCity tool for building our resume and it was like one part of that platform.

Q: Did you find automated screening (ATS) or video AI feedback impacted you?
- A: In the beginning it was really useful because I have a habit of looking up a lot when I'm thinking, when I'm trying to — so it helps me realise "oh, I shouldn't look up." Also, some interviews were automated so they used AI to score, you know, ATS stuff. For video format as well, they look at whether you're looking up, how you're using your hands, where you are looking — are you scoffing, are you shifting a lot? Those are more stressful.

Q: What behavioural feedback did you get?
- A: I got feedback a lot that I said "um" a lot, and that when we really think about how I speak, I should speak more slowly. I kind of didn't realise how I speak until someone pointed out these things. So being reminded of that is helpful. The school recommended some commands on your first cut [practice] — they help.

Q: When solving a coding question, what do you do if you don't understand?
- A: I go to the solutions — I look through what other people have done, then I try to see if I can do it on my own without looking again. I don't usually watch videos of people. It's all just written posts. There are some nice niche algorithms which we didn't cover in school, so sometimes it's confusing. When you throw this information at me, it's like, "okay, there's this thing" and then you have five different pointers collecting it, connecting that, and then using dynamic programming — it's complicated. So I look through what they have and the explanations. Most of the time it's step-by-step. I try the question; if I really can't think of anything and I'm stuck for a long time, I get frustrated. It depends on the question. Sometimes a question is interesting and I keep thinking about it; sometimes 15 minutes in I'm like, "I can't take the pain" and I go to the solutions.

Q: Do you implement a solution before checking the official one?
- A: I usually try to implement a solution to see if I have the right idea. Then I go to the solutions and see what's the lowest complexity people have achieved and I look for the language I'm working in. If I can understand the code I look at it; if not, I read write-ups. Sometimes I draw it step-by-step to understand what's happening in each part. Then I try the questions again and eventually it becomes easy because I understand it.

Q: Would you pay for a prep product/service?
- A: No. No — probably not.

Q: How much time does each question take you?
- A: For easy questions: about 15–20 minutes depending on code length. For medium questions: maybe 5 minutes to understand, 10–15 minutes to devise a possible solution, then 10–15 minutes debugging. If it runs, I spend maybe 15 minutes comparing with others. If it doesn't run or it's high complexity, I'll spend like 50–120 minutes trying to understand and write it down.

Q: When did you last do coding practice regularly?
- A: The last time I did code was when preparing for interviews back in school. I used to do last-minute preparation: one week or maybe three or four days of just sitting and doing LeetCode and hitting my head on the table trying to avoid frustration. I think it's also a discipline thing. I'm not a disciplined person in general. I sit down and plan to do it but then I don't. I have a lot of hobbies — maybe I'll start reading a novel or a manga or a show — so I get distracted.

Q: How does commute/time factor into your study routine?
- A: Right now I live very close to work — 15 minutes walk — so I don't have a commute. Before, I used to read novels during commute, so I had to restrict that because I was reading novels all the time. I said, "okay, I'll read novels while eating." It's like two hours during lunch because three hours during dinner/night. I find it hard to give up the reading. So I force myself to look at my messages to write whenever I'm waiting somewhere sometimes. I really like shifting things around. I know I need to do something, so I need to figure out a schedule. One thing I want to start is like set aside two hours — like one hour before bed — to code. I think I need to start doing that to actually start properly.

Q: You mentioned reading — do you set aside time?
- A: No, I don't set aside time for reading because I can just read on my phone; it's accessible. I'm obsessed with stories — that's my default. I'm always thinking of stories, imagining them. Because reading takes more brain power and energy I won't set aside a specific time, I just do it while eating or side-by-side with other things. That's why I don't need a big setup. I do binge reading sometimes — finish a novel in like three hours. With anime I don't usually go longer than three or four seasons — I get distracted. I've watched three seasons and then I give up. I often have six or seven things on the go at once. For example, Demon Slayer — the movie came out; I watched the first season three years ago and never picked it up again until my friend suggested the movie and then I finished the manga and then I watched the movie days later.

Q: Do you have a pattern to finish novels/series?
- A: Sometimes I finish things in one day if it's a novel or short series. For dramas or K-dramas they have many episodes but if it's interesting enough I'll binge it. Generally I watch a few episodes in the morning, work, watch a couple at lunch, work again, then watch more — it's like micro-sessions. Interruptions usually come when I do regular things — cooking, showering. Those are the only interruptions that pull me away.

Q: How does this affect side projects?
- A: It's hard to do projects because it's a lot of setup and you need to be in the mindset, in the coding zone — set things up and put aside time. That's why it's hard. However, I was quite regular with one learning thing — I think it's called "Cosmo" or something — where I was learning React. For a period I was very regular because it was gamified: each question took less time, progress was saved, it felt gamey and had instant gratification. It gave rewards and certificates, animations — Instagram-style gratification. It made me consistent. They also had a mobile app, and the progress, experience and rewards helped. There was also another app I tried — mini bite-sized topics with small questions in the middle; it was helpful but not deep.

Q: Are you consistent with these apps?
- A: Not very consistent overall. I had a period of being consistent for maybe a month. But if I skip one day I tend to stop and never go back. It's more of a me problem — I said I have "ADFC" which I use to mean attention/concentration difficulties — consistency is hard for me generally. If I don't do it for a month, it's hard to come back.

Q: How long do your binge sessions last?
- A: If I get into a thing, I binge — finish a novel in like three hours. With series, I don't often go beyond three or four seasons. I often have multiple shows going on simultaneously.

Q: Anything else about habit/gamification that matters to you?
- A: The gamified stuff works for me. Cosmo (or whatever the actual name is) had a friendly UI and saved progress. It offered rewards and certificates; that engaged me. Another app, Coursera (they spelled it earlier), I find formal and I get bored. But apps with small chunks and save/continue features are better for me.

Q: Any closing thoughts?
- A: I think I need to set a routine and make a small commitment every day. I have many hobbies and story obsession, which makes it easy to get distracted. If a product is light, gamified, and supports bite-sized wins, I'm more likely to use it. That’s basically it. Thank you.
